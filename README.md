# Getting Started

You need to add you'r own key in file 'requests.js' const API_KEY = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' and boom, ready to play! I modified the code (a little bit) because it did not work, but now it does =)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
